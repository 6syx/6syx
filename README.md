- 👋 Hi, I’m @notjustleo, a 16 year old programmer from Wisconsin.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, chess, and gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more node.js packages to make every bot I make more collaborative with other services.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment.
- 📫 You may reach me on Discord below, Twitter at [@kanyewestlov_r](https://twitter.com/kanyewestlov_r), and by email at leo@justleo.me.
